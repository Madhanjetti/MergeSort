# MergeSort in C:
Merge Sort is one of the best examples of Divide & Conquer algorithm.
In Merge sort, we divide the array recursively in two halves, until each sub-array contains a single element, and
then we merge the sub-array in a way that it results into a sorted array. merge() function merges two sorted sub-arrays into one, wherein it assumes that array[l .. n] and arr[n+1 .. r] are sorted.
